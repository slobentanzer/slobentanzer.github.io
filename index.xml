      <description>About I am a pharmacologist turned research software engineer, and I am particularly interested in disentangling causal relationships in molecular biology. I pursue this goal as a part of the lab of Julio Saez-Rodriguez at the Heidelberg University Hospital.
Effectively dealing with the avalanche of biomedical measurements of today - without throwing away large parts of the data - requires a smart digital infrastructure. Thus, I am actively developing a unified framework for biomedical knowledge representation, BioCypher, as well as the prior knowledge database OmniPath, with the aim of automating harmonisation of biomedical representations for a multitude of research tasks.</description>

      <description>Teaching I have been teaching a variety of courses since the beginning of my PhD in 2015, usually single-topic courses and short series between 2 and 8 hours, in several areas of the life sciences.
Medical Informatics (elective project-based course) Mapping of ontology terms based on internal representation of biomedically trained Large Language Models (Heidelberg University Hospital, &amp;lsquo;Digital Medicine&amp;rsquo;). Annotation of single cells based on gene markers and free text using a combination of Large Language Models and ontology tools (Heidelberg University Hospital, &amp;lsquo;Digital Medicine&amp;rsquo;).</description>
