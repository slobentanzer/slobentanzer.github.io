      <description>About I am a pharmacologist turned research software engineer, and I am particularly interested in disentangling causal relationships in molecular biology. I pursue this goal as a part of the lab of Julio Saez-Rodriguez at the Heidelberg University Hospital since 2021, and in affiliation with the Open Targets group at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) since 2024.
Effectively dealing with the avalanche of biomedical measurements of today - without throwing away large parts of the data - requires a smart digital infrastructure.</description>
